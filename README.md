# SPORE Course Registration System

SPORE is a fully-featured course registration system, including a web-based frontend for collecting student preferences and a backend for translating reported preferences and optimizing course allocations.

## Project Structure
- `SPORE.pdf`: technical background and project overview
- `bundle.py`: implements the full adapted A-CEEI algorithm, optimizing course allocations provided input data in numerical format (currently only operates on randomly-generated data)
- `strict_bundle.py`: implements a simplified version of the A-CEEI algorithm where course bundles are indivisible (only works on special configurations of data)
- `cmu.py`: implements an experimental version of the A-CEEI algorithm using pure MIP (no optimality guarantees)

## Team Members
